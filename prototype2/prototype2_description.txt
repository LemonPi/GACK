- In prototype 1 colour variation enforced by 6-ary constraint (spring colour different from neighbour spring color OR summer different from neighbour summer OR fall different from neighbour fall)
- Replace with three binary constraints of equal weight
- Expect that in worst case 1/3 can be satisfied like before
- Performance bad: solver tries to satisfy all of them; not possible
- Need to put minimum value (117 was minimum seen after running solver for a long time) to let it terminate on reasonable solution
