In prototype 1, four groups of constraints are enforced:

- Hard constraint: For each cell, the combination of spring color, summer color, fall color, height, and moisture must be satisfiable by a plant.
- Hard constraint: For each cell, its moisture must be within 1 of all their neighbour's moisture.
- Hard constraint: A cell closer to the edge of the bed must have a lower or equal height compared to its neighbours with higher height.
- Soft constraint: For each cell, it must have a different colour than its neighbours in either spring, summer, or fall.

Cell 3 is hardcoded to have red in the summer to simulate a user's input/preferences.

Values are chosen in the order specified when defining a variable's domain - so reds and oranges are populated more often as they are at the front of the list of colours. Reversing this list gives more violets and blues instead.

The CSP is solved through ToulBar2 and the solution is displayed using draw_results.html.
